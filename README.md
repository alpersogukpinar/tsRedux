# tsRedux
Experiment using TypseScript, Redux and Angular (1.4).

The application in itself is not very useful: load a list of Regions, and allow to search in it.
Implementation is more interesting:
 - Connect factory (mimic @connect in react)
 - uses [reselect](https://github.com/faassen/reselect)
 - combining selectors
